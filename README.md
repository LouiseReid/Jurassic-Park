# Jurassic-Park

Java/Android Project Definitions - Solo Project

Goal: Practice OO modelling in Java (unit tests, no UI)

You have been asked to create an app to manage the dinosaur population and visitor tracking of Jurassic Park. (No expense spared)

MVP

The user must be able to add paddocks, add / remove dinosaurs to paddocks, feed dinosaurs. You should also be able to transfer Herbivores between paddocks. :/

Project Extensions

Dinosaurs marked as herbivores can live in the same paddock but those marked as carnivores can only be placed with dinosaurs of the same type.
Dinosaurs can randomly rampage and break out of their paddocks.
Visitors can enter / exit the park if the dinosaurs are not rampaging.
View the number of visitors in the park at a given time.
Anything else you can dream up!
